Work with Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.34.gff3 file.
Write a script that would select information
about CDS features for user-specified chromosome
and present data as tab-delimited file with 6 columns. 

Here is an example of the output(partial) for chromosome II:

Chromosome	Start	Stop	Length	CDSID	ProteinID
II	280	2658	2379	YBL113C	YBL113C
II	646	1128	483	YBL113W-A	YBL113W-A
II	2582	2899	318	YBL112C	YBL112C
II	2907	4116	1210	YBL111C	YBL111C
II	4216	5009	794	YBL111C	YBL111C
II	5790	6125	336	YBL109W	YBL109W
II	7605	7733	129	YBL108C-A	YBL108C-A
II	8177	8482	306	YBL108W	YBL108W
II	9268	9372	105	YBL107W-A	YBL107W-A

Further instructions:
1. Call your script Gff3ToNew_YourFirstName_YourLastName.sh
2. You should supply 3 arguments to your script at the command line.
The three arguments are: input, chromosome, output.
3. Use whatever commands you want(within the scope of this corse)
to accomplish the task, but practicing AWK here is highly recommended.
4. Make MyHW6 folder in your CTools_Spring2017 folder.
Assume I have Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.34.gff3 there.
Your script should run from MyHW6.
5. You can check for tabs in your final output with `cat -T` command.
Tabs will be indicated by `^I` symbol.
5. Provide an example of how to run your script in the comment section
on BlackBoard when you submit your file.
6. ASK me if these instructions are not clear.
